This project is part of the **ALX Backend Python** curriculum.  
It focuses on writing **unit tests** and **integration tests** using Python's `unittest` framework and related tools such as `parameterized`.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand the difference between unit and integration testing.
- Learn how to structure tests using `unittest.TestCase`.
- Use the `parameterized` library to test multiple inputs.
- Validate behavior and error handling in Python functions and classes.
- Gain confidence in writing **testable** and **robust** code.
